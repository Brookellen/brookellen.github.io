								<h5>Fact 1</h5>
								<h3>Women are people!</h3>
								<p>If you, too, are a person, this should be great news! You’ve already got things in common—likes, dislikes, feelings, thoughts, and more. It’s a great place to start.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="fact">
							<h5>Fact 2</h5>
							<h3>They possess intelligence.</h3>
							<p>Like men, women are passed down traits from their parents, one of which being some level of intelligence. Don’t go in thinking you’re bound to dazzle her with your wit simply because you’re a guy, instead, assume that she can keep up just fine--and may be able to challenge you.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="fact">
							<h5>Fact 3</h5>
							<h3>They have various talents and interests.</h3>
							<p>Women have a variety of different interests. Some like to draw, some like to play basketball, some like to cook. Some hate to cook. Paying attention to what she enjoys can help you tap into common interests, thus providing an opportunity to establish rapport.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="fact">
							<h5>Fact 4</h5>
							<h3>They retain equal rights.</h3>
							<p>No matter what happens, women are people and therefore they deserve equal rights. This could mean allowing her to pay for the drinks, but it also means that when a woman decides she is not interested in your attention, she deserves respect and space, not name-calling, intimidation, and shaming.</p>
